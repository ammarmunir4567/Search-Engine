# SearchEnginePlusPlus (SE++)

## Project Description

SearchEnginePlusPlus (SE++) is a C++ program that implements a basic search engine with additional features such as substring search, misspelled word search, and search history maintenance. This project is part of an assignment and fulfills specific requirements related to file handling, tokenization, and search functionalities.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code files.
  - `main.cpp`: Main C++ file containing the implementation of the search engine functions.
  - `l20XXXX_q_no.cpp`: Individual C++ files for different parts of the assignment.
- **`data/`**: Sample data files required for the program to function.
  - `stoplist.txt`: List of stop words.
  - `docslist.txt`: List of documents.
- **`output/`**: Output files generated by the program.
  - `docids.txt`: Mapping of document filenames to unique integers.
  - `termids.txt`: Mapping of terms to unique integers.
  - `doc_index.txt`: Forward index containing the positions of terms in documents.
  - `history.txt`: Search history log file.
- **`README.md`**: This file, containing information about the project.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SearchEnginePlusPlus.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd SearchEnginePlusPlus
   ```

3. **Compile and Run:**
   ```
   g++ src/*.cpp -o search_engine
   ./search_engine
   ```

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
   - Enter 'yes' to skip PART-I or 'no' to follow the sequence.
   - Enter search terms as prompted and view the results.
   - The program will maintain a search history in the `output/history.txt` file.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to replace `l20XXXX_q_no.cpp` with your actual C++ files containing the implementation for different parts of the assignment.
- Modify the sample data files (`stoplist.txt`, `docslist.txt`) or add more data files as needed for testing.
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile and run the program.
